# Pokemon-App

This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The project is an attempt to explore the [Pokemon Api]((https://pokeapi.co)) and learn about the world of Pokemon Go. The following technologies were used in this project:

- [React](http://react.dev) – Javascript Library for building user interfaces
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) – React Framework for the web
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) – React Hooks for Data Fetching
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) – Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) – Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) – Styling
